# Enterprise Platform for Operational Performance (EPOP) - App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up
When a new user first visits the application, they arrive at the public landing page where they can choose to register or sign in. To register, the user clicks the sign-up button and is presented with a form requiring name, email address, and password. Upon submitting valid details, the system sends a confirmation email for password verification and activates their account once they follow the link. Signing in requires entering the registered email and password. After successful authentication, the backend issues a JWT access token and a secure, HTTP-only refresh token stored in a cookie. Should the user forget their password, they click the “Forgot Password” link on the sign-in page, enter their email, and receive a password reset link. Following that link brings them to a secure page where they choose a new password. Signing out is available at any time through the user menu in the top bar and instantly revokes the local access token and clears the refresh cookie.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page
After signing in, the user lands on the Dashboard Home. The page is divided into a fixed sidebar on the left and a top bar across the top. The sidebar displays key sections labeled Inbox, Projects, and Directory. The top bar presents a global search field on the left and a user menu with profile and sign-out on the right. Below the top bar, the main area is filled with widgets showing today’s calendar events, key performance metrics, and a compact view of the organization directory. From this view, the user can click Inbox to see conversations, click Projects to view or create projects, or click Directory to browse company members. Navigation between these sections happens instantly without a full page reload, leveraging the app router for a seamless single-page experience.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions
### Messaging and Real-Time Conversation Flow
When the user selects Inbox, the application fetches the list of recent conversations via an API call. Clicking a conversation opens a pane showing the message history. The client establishes a Socket.IO connection using the valid access token and subscribes to real-time events for new messages, typing indicators, and read receipts. Typing in the message composer triggers a “user is typing” event. Sending a message posts the content to the server, which stores it in the database, broadcasts it over the WebSocket, and returns it to the client for immediate display.

### File Upload Flow
Inside the message composer, the user clicks to attach a file. The client requests a presigned upload URL from the server through an API endpoint. The server generates the MinIO presigned URL and returns it. The client then uploads the file directly to MinIO using that URL. Upon success, the client sends the file metadata in a follow-up API call to associate it with the message. The new message with file attachment appears in the conversation and is broadcast in real time.

### Project Management Flow
Selecting Projects in the sidebar takes the user to the Projects list page, which loads all projects the user belongs to. The user clicks the “New Project” button to open a project creation form that captures name, description, and team members. Submitting the form calls the projects API, which writes the new project into the database. The user is then redirected to the individual project page at a URL containing the project ID. On the project detail page, tabs allow switching between Kanban board view, Gantt chart view, and a task list. Each interaction triggers client-side routing and relevant API calls to fetch or update project data.

### Calendar and Scheduling Flow
Clicking the calendar widget or the calendar icon in the sidebar brings the user to the full calendar page. The calendar fetches events via an API call and displays them in a month or week view. To create a new event, the user clicks a date or time slot, filling in title, description, participants, and reminder settings. Saving the event posts it to the server. The calendar instantly updates and notifies invited participants in real time via Socket.IO and optional push notifications.

### Organization Directory Flow
When Directory is selected, the user sees a searchable list of all organization members along with their roles and contact details. The search field at the top filters results by name or department. Clicking a member’s name opens a profile card with full information, including recent activity and messaging options. The user can start a new conversation directly from this profile view.

### Admin Panel Flow
For users with administrator roles, an Admin link appears in the sidebar. Clicking it navigates to the Admin Dashboard where user management and system settings are available. The user list API populates a table showing all accounts. The administrator can activate or deactivate accounts, reset passwords, assign roles, and view audit logs. Each action invokes a protected API endpoint and refreshes the view on success.

## Settings and Account Management
Accessed from the user menu in the top bar, the Settings page lets users update their profile details such as name, email, and password. There is a section for notification preferences where the user can toggle email and push notifications. Under device settings, the user sees a list of registered FCM tokens and can revoke them to sign out of specific devices. All changes are saved via API calls and confirmed with on-screen feedback. After updating settings, the user can click “Back to Dashboard” in the header or use the sidebar to return to the main app flow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths
If the user enters incorrect sign-in credentials, an inline error appears asking them to check their email and password. During password reset, expired or invalid tokens show a message prompting the user to restart the flow. In the dashboard, if an API call fails due to network issues, a banner alert is displayed with a retry button. Should the real-time connection drop, the chat interface shows a reconnect indicator and automatically attempts to reestablish the WebSocket. Attempting a restricted action such as accessing a project without proper role redirects the user to a “403 Forbidden” page explaining insufficient permissions and provides a link to contact an administrator.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey
A user begins by discovering the application on a public landing page, then registers with email and password. Once authenticated, they enter the protected dashboard, greeted by key metrics, calendar events, and navigation to Inbox, Projects, and Directory. From there, the user seamlessly composes real-time messages with file attachments, manages projects in Kanban or calendar views, schedules events, and browses colleagues in the directory. Administrators gain access to user and system settings through the admin panel. Throughout the experience, settings and notifications remain easily configurable, and robust error handling keeps users informed and in control. Over time, these flows support the everyday mission of coordinating teams, tracking tasks, and maintaining operational performance.
